					<h2> Attribute based encryption approach for sharing, storing and retrieval of 
the encrypted data in the cloud. </h2>
					<p>
						Description: One of the most cost-effective thing now-a-days is used for storing 
the data. The Data is collected from everywhere like MNC companies, Business 
Industries, etc.. That are stored in Hard disk, Physical Records So, to overcome 
this problem I have come up with this project. 
Here, we use RSA algorithm, it is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. 
Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key 
and Private Key. We use these keys for authentication. 
We use three modules they are: Data Owner, Data User and Cloud Service 
Provider. Owner can add the data in the cloud and user can access the data by 
login with the credentials. In this way we can store our data safe and securely. 
And can retrieve the data or modify the data when required.  </p></div>

				<h2> Hospital web development.</h2>
				<p>
					Description: Itâ€™s a front-end web development. Designed it using HTML and 
CSS. I have an idea to connect it with the back-end using Django. So that we 
can access patient and doctor Database. Still am working on this project but I 
have done with the front-end part.
